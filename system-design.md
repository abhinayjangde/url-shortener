How to learn system design 


ChatGPT said:
Good question 👍 Before we dive into a plan, let me get a sense of where you are.

Are you preparing for interviews (like software engineer roles), or learning system design for your own projects?

And what’s your current background — for example, do you already know how web applications work (client-server, APIs, databases), or should we start from the ground up?

This way I can give you a study path that fits you.



You said:
I am a fresher, i have some experience of building web applications and deploying theme. So I want to learn system design to build my projects.

Yes, 8 already know basic terminologies and I have worked on it.


ChatGPT said:
Perfect — that’s a strong starting point 👌 Since you’ve already built and deployed web apps, we can treat system design as the next level of thinking: not just writing code, but designing scalable, reliable, and efficient systems.

Here’s a roadmap we can follow step by step (with some interactive check-ins along the way):

🛠 Roadmap for Learning System Design
1. Strengthen Fundamentals
Networking basics: HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, Load Balancers, CDN

Databases: SQL vs NoSQL, indexing, transactions, sharding, replication

Caching: Why and where to use (Redis, Memcached)

Storage: Blob storage, file vs block, backups

👉 Activity: Next time, we can sketch a simple system like a URL shortener and see how caching + databases fit in.

2. Core System Design Concepts
Scalability (vertical vs horizontal)

Availability (redundancy, failover)

Consistency vs Latency trade-offs (CAP theorem)

Rate limiting & throttling

Event-driven architecture

👉 Tip: Start with high-level block diagrams instead of diving into tech stack details.

3. Learn with Real Examples
Design a URL shortener (TinyURL)

Design a chat system (like WhatsApp)

Design an online code editor

Design an e-commerce site (like Amazon)

👉 We’ll build complexity gradually: from a single server → distributed system.

4. Tools & Patterns
Message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS)

Microservices vs Monoliths

Monitoring & logging (Prometheus, ELK)

API Gateway, Reverse Proxy

5. Practice & Feedback
Read system design case studies (e.g., Uber, Netflix)

Use mock interviews or whiteboard practice

Teach back: explain your design choices to a friend (or me)

⚡ To make this stick, we’ll mix learning with practice projects.
Question for you:
Do you want me to start by walking you through a small system design example (like a URL shortener), or first go deeper into the theory (networking, databases, caching)?






You said:
Let's start through a small system design example 


ChatGPT said:
Great choice 👍 Let’s start small and hands-on. We’ll take a URL Shortener (like TinyURL) because it touches many core system design ideas but isn’t overwhelming.

We’ll go step by step. Here’s the scenario:

We want to design a service where users can input a long URL, and we give them a short link that redirects to the original.

Step 1: Requirements
We always start with requirements.
Let’s split them:

Functional requirements

User can submit a long URL and get a short one.

Visiting the short URL should redirect to the long one.

Non-functional requirements

Fast redirection (low latency).

Handle lots of reads (redirects) and fewer writes (URL creations).

Highly available.

💡 Question for you:
If you had to choose, which operation do you think will happen much more often — creating a new short URL, or visiting/using an existing short URL?






You said:
I think visiting an existing short URL 


ChatGPT said:
Exactly 👌 That’s a key insight:

Writes (creating short URLs) → relatively rare

Reads (redirects) → extremely frequent

This will guide our design. For example, we’ll want fast lookup for redirects (maybe with caching) rather than focusing heavily on optimizing the creation step.

Step 2: High-Level Design
Here’s the basic flow:

User requests a short URL
→ Service generates a short code (like abcd123) and stores it with the original URL in a database.

Another user visits the short URL
→ Service looks up the short code in the database → finds the original URL → redirects.

To make this concrete:

Frontend: simple UI (or API) where user submits a URL.

Backend Service: handles requests, generates codes, stores/retrieves mappings.

Database: stores mapping {short_code → long_url}.

Cache (optional, for performance): stores popular short codes.

💡 Your Turn:
If we want to generate a unique short code for each long URL, what’s one way you think we could create that short code?






You said:
I think I can use hashing, because we we use hashing algorithm it give unique value for unique input 


ChatGPT said:
Perfect reasoning 👏 Hashing is indeed one of the main strategies!
But let’s think a bit deeper:

Using Hashing
If we take a long URL and run it through a hashing algorithm (say MD5 or SHA256), we get a fixed-length string.

We can then shorten it further (say first 7–8 characters) to make it user-friendly.

Challenge:

Hash collisions (two different URLs producing the same short code if we truncate).

Very long hash strings are not nice for “short” URLs.

Another Common Approach
Use a counter (auto-increment ID) and encode it in Base62 (a–z, A–Z, 0–9).

Example:

First URL → ID 1 → encoded as b

Second URL → ID 2 → encoded as c

And so on.

This guarantees uniqueness and is easy to decode.

So in practice, many systems use:

Hashing + collision handling
OR

Base62 encoding with a counter

💡 Question for you:
Imagine our service suddenly becomes popular and stores millions of URLs.
If we keep all mappings only in a database, what potential performance issue could arise during redirects?






You said:
Reading from table will take more time, throughput 


ChatGPT said:
Exactly 👍
If millions of redirects hit the database every second, the read latency goes up and throughput drops. That’s a bottleneck.

Step 3: Optimization → Add a Cache
We can fix this by adding a cache (like Redis or Memcached) in front of the database:

Flow during redirect:

User clicks short URL

Backend checks cache for the short code

If found → return original URL (super fast 🚀)

If not found → query database, then store the result in cache for next time

This way, the database only handles cache misses, not every single redirect.

So far, our design looks like this:

User → Backend Service → Cache → Database

⚡ Quick Check:
If a URL mapping in the cache expires (gets evicted) but users are still clicking it, what happens?






You said:
So I thise case , backend read original url from database, store it in cache for specific time (with expiry) and send it to frontend for redirection 


ChatGPT said:
Perfect 🎯 You nailed it!
That’s called a cache miss followed by cache fill. It ensures the system still works even if the cache doesn’t hold the item.

Step 4: Putting It Together
Here’s our URL Shortener v1 design:

Create Short URL

Backend receives long URL

Generates short code (via hashing or Base62 encoding an ID)

Stores {short_code → long_url} in the database

Redirect

User visits short URL

Backend checks cache

If hit → return original URL quickly

If miss → query DB, update cache, then return

Step 5: Scalability Ideas
If traffic grows:

Load Balancer in front of multiple backend servers

Database replication for read-heavy workload

CDN if serving static assets with the redirects

Rate limiting to prevent abuse

Before we move on to sketching a block diagram of this system:
💡 Would you like us to add one more advanced feature (like custom short URLs, analytics, or high availability),
or stop here and draw a clean diagram for v1?






You said:
I am a beginner so let's stop here and draw a clean diagram 


ChatGPT said:
Perfect call 👍 Starting simple is the best way to really get it.
Here’s a clean block diagram for URL Shortener v1:

       +---------+  +---------+
Flow:

User submits / visits short URL → request goes through Load Balancer

Backend handles request:

On create: generates code → stores in DB

On redirect: checks Cache → if miss, fetch from DB → update cache

Returns original URL for redirection

⚡ Quick Review Question for you:
Why do we place a cache before the database instead of the other way around?






You said:
Because first we check our cache that we have url or not


ChatGPT said:
Exactly 👍 You’ve got it.

We check the cache first because:

Cache is in-memory → much faster than a disk-based database.

Most requests are repeats (many people clicking the same short links).

This reduces the load on the database, keeping the whole system faster and more scalable.

✅ So we’ve completed your first system design (URL Shortener v1).

Would you like to try designing another simple system yourself (with me guiding step by step),
or should we review a few key concepts from this design before moving on?






You said:
Let's review key concepts


ChatGPT said:
Great idea 👍 Reviewing will make the design stick.

Here’s a mini-review of what we just did with the URL Shortener:

🔑 Key Concepts from URL Shortener v1
Functional vs Non-functional Requirements

Functional = what the system does (create + redirect URLs)

Non-functional = qualities (fast, available, scalable)

Read-heavy Workload

Redirects >> URL creations

So we optimized for reads

Short Code Generation

Hashing: good but risk of collisions

Base62 encoding with counter/ID: simple and collision-free

Cache in Front of Database

Cache hit = super fast redirect

Cache miss = fallback to DB, then store in cache

Scalability Basics

Load balancer to distribute requests

DB replication for heavy reads

Rate limiting to prevent abuse

💡 Quick Check for You:
If suddenly our service gets 10x more traffic, which two components in our design are most likely to become bottlenecks first?






You said:
I think Backend Server and Database but I am not sure 


ChatGPT said:
That’s exactly right 👍 — and it shows you’re thinking in the right direction.

Why those two?
Backend Server

Has to handle every request (create + redirect).

With 10x traffic, a single server could max out CPU / memory.

Fix: add multiple backend servers behind a load balancer.

Database

Redirect lookups flood the DB if the cache isn’t big enough.

Writes (new URLs) are fewer, but still add up.

Fix: use caching effectively and consider DB replication (many read replicas).

👉 The cache helps shield the database, but the backend servers and DB are still the first to strain under big traffic.

⚡ Mini-Exercise:
Suppose we already scaled backend servers horizontally (using a load balancer).
If the database still struggles, what’s one technique (besides caching) we could use to distribute the DB load?






You said:
That's all for today, we will learn tomorrow 


ChatGPT said:
Sounds good 👍 You did really well today — we covered your first system design (URL Shortener v1) and reviewed the key concepts.

When we continue tomorrow, we can either:

Level up this design (adding custom URLs, analytics, or high availability), or

Start a new example (maybe designing a chat app or an e-commerce system).

Do you want me to give you a quick 2‑minute recap tomorrow before we continue, or jump straight into the next design?
